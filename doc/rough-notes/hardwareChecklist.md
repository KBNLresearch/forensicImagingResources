## Hardware checklist

|Hardware|In stock?|Comments|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Dedicated desktop for disk imaging / data extraction|1|Machine with BitCurator as main OS|
|Separate desktop / laptop|?|Needed for looking up on-line documentation, and documenting the recovery process (lab book)|
|Write blockers|-|SATA/IDE; USB; possibly SCSI (most vendors appear to have discontinued SCSI blockers)|
|USB 3.5" floppy drives|1|[Doesn't work for e.g. Mac-formatted discs](https://porterolsen.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/accessing-mac-formatted-floppy-disks-without-the-kryoflux/); might not play well with USB write blockers|
|5.25" floppy drives|1|I think we have at least 1 in storage, needs checking|
|Controller for 5.25" floppy drive/ USB adapter|-|Several options are listed [here](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php/Rescuing_Floppy_Disks). Many colleagues use   [Kryoflux](https://www.kryoflux.com/); for 5.25" drives [Device Side Data's FC5025](http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html) looks like an interesting (and cheap) option|
|ZIP drives|?|I think we have at least 1 in storage, needs checking|
|Tape drive, DDS-1|1|[Digital Data Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Data_Storage)
|Tape drive, DLT-IV|1|[Digital Linear Tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Linear_Tape)|
|Old, unimportant DDS-1 and DLT-IV tapes for testing|Yes, several|Needed for testing the tape readers, as we don't want to accidentally destroy any important tapes because the tape readers are not working properly!|
|SCSI PCI card(s)|-|Needed for connecting SCSI tape drives. A bit tricky because of the plethora of SCSI variants and connectors; see also [here](http://qanda.digipres.org/1160/best-way-to-read-scsi-tape-drive-on-a-modern-pc)|
|Various SCSI converters||See also the [SCSI Connector Guide](https://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/scsi)|
|Various cables and adapters||Useful resources are [The Cable Bible](https://amiaopensource.github.io/cable-bible/), [SCSI Connector Guide](https://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/scsi) and [the SCSI articles on Paralan](http://www.paralan.com/aboutscsi.html)|
|Power strips; spare power cables|-||
|Cans of compressed air for blowing away dust|||
|Utility kit with screwdrivers|||
|Camera (for documentation)|-||
|Grounded bench|-|Needed to for working with electronic components. Room may need other measures to reduce electrostatic discharge. See e.g. [this blog about Michigan University's Digital Preservation Lab](https://www.lib.umich.edu/blogs/bits-and-pieces/digital-preservation-lab-20)|
